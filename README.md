#  Java Programming Hub
  
This repository showcases Java programs that explore **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** fundamentals and **advanced Java features**.  
Each program is focused on a single concept with **clear code and helpful comments** to aid learning.

##  Core Java Concepts

- **Classes & Objects**  
  Build classes, instantiate objects, and use constructors.

- **Inheritance**  
  Implement single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.

- **Polymorphism**  
  Achieve flexibility with method overloading and overriding.

- **Encapsulation**  
  Protect data using access modifiers and getter/setter methods.

- **Abstraction**  
  Simplify complexity with abstract classes and interfaces.

- **Packages**  
  Organize code for better modularity and reuse.

- **Exception Handling**  
  Manage errors with try-catch, throw, and custom exceptions.

- **Collections**  
  Work with `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, and more.

- **File I/O**  
  Read and write files using `File`, `BufferedReader`, and `FileWriter`.

- **Strings**  
  Manipulate text with `String`, `StringBuilder`, and `StringBuffer`.

##  Advanced Java Features

- **Multithreading**  
  Create and synchronize threads for concurrent programming.

- **JDBC**  
  Connect to databases and perform CRUD operations.

- **Swing Framework**  
  Build interactive desktop GUIs with `JFrame`, `JButton`, and `JTable`.
