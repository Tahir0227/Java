Programming in Java

This repository contains Java programs demonstrating key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and advanced Java features. Each file focuses on a specific concept with clear code examples 

ðŸ”¹ Core Java Concepts





Classes and Objects: Defining classes, creating objects, constructors, and instance methods.



Inheritance: Single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance with practical examples.



Polymorphism: Method overloading (compile-time) and method overriding (runtime).



Encapsulation: Data hiding using access modifiers (private, protected, public) and getters/setters.



Abstraction: Abstract classes and interfaces for defining contracts and hiding implementation.



Packages: Organizing code into packages for modularity and namespace management.



Exception Handling: Try-catch blocks, throw, throws, and custom exceptions.



Collections Framework: ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, HashSet, and other collection classes.



Input/Output (I/O): File handling with File, FileReader, FileWriter, and BufferedReader.



Java Strings: String manipulation, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer.

ðŸ”¸ Advanced Java Concepts





Multithreading: Thread creation, lifecycle, synchronization, thread pools, and concurrent utilities.



JDBC: Database connectivity, executing SQL queries, and handling result sets.



Swing Framework: Creating desktop GUI applications with components like JFrame, JButton, JTable, and event handling.



Lambda Expressions: Functional programming with lambda expressions and functional interfaces.



Generics: Type-safe classes and methods using generics for reusability.
